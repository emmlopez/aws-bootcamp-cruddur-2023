# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
I was able to complete the required assigments :
- recreate Dockerfile for backend, build an image and run the container for that docker image.
- debug docker build by attaching shell or adding pyhtong print() to see if env variables are set or not.
- Dockerized Frontend and recreated docker-compose
- Recreated notifications backend Endpoint.
- Learned gitpod vscode shortcut for copy line down  shift+Alt+down arrow
- Install postgress client into gitpod


issues
- permission denied when pushing code to my repo, I edited gitpod permissions by :   user settings>integrations>github (click actions ellipsis)>edit permissions
