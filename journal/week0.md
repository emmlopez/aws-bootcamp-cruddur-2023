# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
for my homework  I was able to learn about how to create a diagram in LucidChart the link is https://lucid.app/lucidchart/bf19f27a-5ea3-4b9a-b0a9-a4a6fc9d04af/edit?view_items=Hycyh_VcjkHj&invitationId=inv_e11a291d-80d9-47f9-a5d5-a7b83261cc24

after watching Andrew Video I learned : how to import icons (momento icon) and use the SVG as part of the diagram
also how to import the AWS architecture 2021 icons
how to label and modified the icons position.
